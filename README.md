# Power BI Project
This repository is the last part of the TechMart project, focussed on in the last two repositories, and aims to deal with the data visualization using Microsoft Power BI. In the first repository [SQL](https://github.com/yosefemshani/SQL-Capstone-Project) was used for data analysis. Secondly, we used [Excel & Tableau](https://github.com/yosefemshani/Tableau-Excel-SQL-Project) for data cleaning, analysis and visualization.

The final project is uploaded in this repository as [PowerBI_Project.ipynb](https://github.com/yosefemshani/PowerBI-Project/blob/main/PowerBI_Project.ipynb).

### Aim of this project
A real-world data analysis challenge is simulated using a dataset from TechMart, a growing retail chain. All used datasets and tables can be found in this repository. Credits to Coursera for the simulated datasets. Prior analysis is visualized using Microsoft Power BI.

## 1. Data Preparation
First of all, datasets (semantic models) are imported and prepared for visualization. This is emphasized in this section.

## 2. Data Visualization
Prior analyzed datasets are visualized within this project to demonstrate how data analysis needs proper visualization instead of numbers listed in a table. Also this project aims to highlight differences and similarities between Tableau and Microsoft Power BI.

## 3. Data Report
Finally, this project is summarized by comparing the visualization results and giving a short debrief of prior mentioned platforms.
